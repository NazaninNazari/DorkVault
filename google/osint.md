# OSINT Workflow
1. Start with the target domain or organization name.
2. Identify publicly indexed documentation and resources.
3. Search for public reports and publications.
4. Identify public code repositories and developer resources.
5. Identify publicly documented technologiesand infrastructure references.
6. Correlate information from multiple public sources.
7. Verify findings before using them in security research.

# Notes
- Replace example.com with a domain you are authorized to research.
- Replace Example Organization with the organization being researched.
- OSINT should rely on information that is publicly available.
- Do not collect, expose or misuse sensitive personal information.
- Do not attempt unauthorized access to discovered services.
- A search result does not prove ownership, vulnerability or security impact.
- These queries are intended for educational purposes, OSINT and authorized security research.
